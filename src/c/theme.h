// clear of whatever the field renders as, without which the falloff quantizes
// a caption and its ground onto the same level.

// and a way for the pass to separate ink against a level the screen is not
// showing. 0 covers Black and every non-grey ground alike; nothing needs to
// tell those apart, since both mean "no separation, take the dark curve".

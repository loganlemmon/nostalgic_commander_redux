// The CRT effect lives entirely here: a full-screen overlay layer stacked
// above the clock whose update proc captures the framebuffer (the public
// graphics_capture_frame_buffer API) and runs a per-pixel pass — a software
// "shader". Stage order: 1) chromatic aberration, 2) vignette + dither (in
// content space, so the darkening bends WITH the curvature; light-background
// themes take a steeper ease-in LUT — dot density over shade, black only at
// the rim — and hold ink one step clear of the level their field renders as,
// which a plain gain quantizes away), 3) curvature — the pincushion warp.
// Each axis maps its edge distance onto the LUTs' 0..16 domain, so
// CRT_VIGNETTE_SIDE_PX and CRT_VIGNETTE_BAND_PX size the four rims on their
// own. The degauss strike's row jitter rides the warp's sampling stage. The
// toggle gates the pass; off means the proc returns before capturing, so the
// effect costs exactly nothing.
//
// main.c owns the layer's lifecycle (create/stack/destroy), like the canvas;
// the handle is mirrored here the way drawing.h mirrors s_canvas_layer.

// Curvature geometry. The warp magnifies radially — dest (x,y) samples
// source at cx + (x-cx)·M/65536 with M = 65536 + CRT_WARP_R2_K·r² (r² = the
// elliptical Q8 xq+yq the CA zones also use). K=8 ≈ 3.1px of pull at a
// mid-edge (r²=256), smoothly more toward the corners. The vignette darkens
// within a band of the nearest edge, counted around the corner arcs.
//
// K also sets how much solid black the sides carry, which is not obvious: the
// outermost dest columns' sources run off the frame and clamp to column 0,
// which the vignette has already taken to depth 0. K=12 clamped four of them,
// and with the depth-0 and depth-1 columns behind it that was 6px of black
// before the falloff got a single pixel — no vignette constant could touch it.
// K=8 clamps three. Lower K is a flatter tube, so this trades bow for rim.
//
// VIGNETTE_PX is the falloff LUTs' domain — 17 sample points, depth 0..16 —
// not a size. Both axes map their edge distance onto that domain, so the two
// BAND constants below set how far the rim actually reaches without touching
// the tuned curves. Shrink or grow the rims there and nowhere else.
#define CRT_VIGNETTE_PX 16
// Side band, in CONTENT px. The warp COMPRESSES the rim inward rather than
// stretching it — 13 source columns land in 12 dest — so this is very nearly
// its own width on the glass, sitting behind the clamp below.
//
// It sets the width of the RAMP, not of the black: the clamp's columns do not
// move with it at all. Judge it with the per-pixel view, never by mean level —
// a mean saturates once a column reaches the field, so it cannot show the ramp
// lengthening at all, and reading one produced a wrong "this constant is
// inert" conclusion that stood here for a while.
//
// On a level-2 field, 12 renders the ladder 1,3,4,5,6 — that jump from 1 to 3
// is the sharp edge coming out of black. 16 renders 1,2,3,4,5,6, every step
// present. Wider still works now that the channels dither out of phase; before
// that, quantization dips punched black columns back through the middle of the
// ramp and made anything past 12 look worse.
#define CRT_VIGNETTE_SIDE_PX 16
// Top/bottom band, in DISPLAY px — the warp is horizontal-only, so nothing
// resamples this axis and it is the figure you see.
//
// Keep (BAND_PX - EDGE_PX + 1) equal to VIGNETTE_PX. The row-to-depth map is
// an integer divide, so any other ratio makes some rows advance two LUT
// depths while their neighbours advance one. At 16 with EDGE_PX 3 that
// divided 16 depths over 14 rows: rows 8 and 9 — the two rows of the top
// slot's border — landed on gains 114 and 158, 44 apart where every other
// step was ~20, so one border row read dimmer than the other and glyphs
// crossing the seam looked like they wobbled. 18 makes it exactly one depth
// per row again.
#define CRT_VIGNETTE_BAND_PX 18
// Rows held at depth 0 before the falloff starts, standing in for the columns
// the warp's clamp renders solid on the sides. Nothing clamps vertically, so
// without it the top carried 2px of black against the sides' 6 and read as
// missing. Track it to the clamp: at K=8 that is three each way.
#define CRT_VIGNETTE_EDGE_PX 3
// Gain below which the falloff is bezel, not content — the light LUT's depths
// 0 to 4, where the field is crushed and nothing is meant to be read. Ink/field
// separation (crt.c's clear_of_ground) stops here so the rim can reach black.
// Compare it against the curve when either changes: depth 4 is 96, which is
// under this, so the boundary sits between depths 4 and 5.

// CA zones by elliptical radius, in the xq+yq units stage 1 already computes:
// 0 at the centre, 256 at a mid-edge, 512 in a corner. Inside R2 the image is
// clean; past it each channel separates, up to 1+1/3px — expressed in THIRDS
// (0..4) because stage 1 samples fractionally, and a per-half ±1 third in the
// pass cancels the panel's built-in element offset (the stripe does not
// mirror: −1 left, +1 right) so the centre converges instead of carrying a
// 2/3px floor.
//
// Horizontal RAMPS from 0 to 4 thirds rather than stepping. A step put a hard
// oval on the glass — a 1+1/3px shift appearing between one pixel and the
// next — and where that oval crossed a complication's text it cut the word in
// half. The fractional sampler could already render thirds; only this zone
// function was quantized. RAMP_SHIFT sets the width: 4 thirds over (4 <<
// SHIFT) units of r², so 5 spans 128 and saturates just inside a mid-edge,
// keeping full strength everywhere it used to be and softening only the onset.
// A shift, not a divide — stage 1 runs this per pixel.
//
// Vertical still steps: its shift is whole rows (the ring samples y±1, there
// is no fractional row), so there is nothing between 0 and 1 to ramp through.
// Its jump is 1px against the horizontal's 1+1/3, and it was not the visible
// edge.
